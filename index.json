However, while prior research has predominantly focused on improving recognition accuracy, little attention has been paid to improving computational efficiency and reducing memory usage. These aspects are critical for deploying face recognition systems, efficiently processing large-scale data, and enabling fast inference. To address this gap, we propose an approach that employs 1-bit activations and weights in widely used face recognition models, such as AdaFace, while preserving high recognition accuracy. Additionally, we significantly accelerate inference by using a custom CUDA kernel tailored to our specific convolutional requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our method, achieving promising results across five standard face recognition datasets. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable face recognition solutions without compromising performance.","tags":[],"title":"EffBin: Efficient Face Recognition via Binary Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Susim M Roy","Bharat Yalavarthi","Nalini Ratha"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1731024e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731024e3,"objectID":"b057bc5f579dd349167e06419d10ca54","permalink":"https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/publication/conference-paper3/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper3/","section":"publication","summary":"The convolution operator in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been a crucial aspect of success in various computer vision tasks. There has been a recent surge in the use of CNNs for generative modeling. However, such techniques usually have a long inference time which is mainly due to the costly convolution operation. Thus, we bring our attention to reducing the total number of mathematical operations during convolution using the Summed Area Table (SAT) and box filters. In this work, we find the redundant box filters that are being repeated across the filter dimension and prune them to save computation. Additionally, we also show that this does not take a toll on the accuracy and instead increases it after finetuning the remaining architecture. Thus, our proposed method computes convolution output with lower latency as compared to using all the box filters, increases classification accuracy, and can be applied with arbitrarily shaped kernels.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Convolutions using Box-Filters for Low-Latency Image Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anubhooti Jain","Susim M Roy","Kwanit Gupta","Mayank Vatsa","Richa Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1726531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1726531200,"objectID":"d6e6088f81e1b2f425d8eb99ae5a9e79","permalink":"https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/publication/conference-paper2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper2/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning models, such as those used for face recognition and attribute prediction, are susceptible to manipulations like adversarial noise and unintentional noise, including Gaussian and impulse noise. This paper introduces CIAI, a class-independent detection network built on a modified vision transformer with detection layers. CIAI employs a novel loss function that combines Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Center Loss to detect both intentional (adversarial attacks) and unintentional noise, regardless of the image class. We illustrate the impact of noise on gender prediction accuracy and evaluate CIAI’s detection performance using the CelebA and LFW datasets. Our findings show that CIAI achieves detection accuracy that is comparable to or better than existing methods, even against previously unseen attacks. Attention maps and t-SNE plots reveal the features that assist in gender prediction and noise detection. Additionally, we present detection results on the AgeDB and CIFAR-10 datasets, further demonstrating the robustness of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Discerning the Chaos: Detecting Adversarial Perturbations while Disentangling Intentional from Unintentional Noises","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prafulla Saxena","Susim M Roy","Santosh K Vipparthi","Dinesh K Tyagi","Subrahmanyam Murala","R.

In segmenting specific moving objects targeted by a text, suppressing other moving as well as stationary objects is a crucial task. A better context needs to be learned where linguistic, spatial, and temporal features need to be taken into account. In this work, we have proposed a robust referred moving object segmentation (RefMOS) framework to capture moving objects referred by text query. Most of the earlier state-of-the-art methods exploit a different type of supervision by treating video frames as images but lack temporal information during processing. In this work, we have proposed an inter-frame movement detector (IFCD) module, which extracts the movement information between the consecutive frames and helps integrate temporal information with spatial visual features. Language embedding is utilized to capture the information of referred moving objects in the text by extracting linguistic features from a pre-trained language model, i.e., BERT. Furthermore, the cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer are used to train the network. Our RefMOS framework competes with the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves 48.6 mean IOU on the ref-DAVIS 17 dataset.","tags":[],"title":"RefMOS: A Robust Referred Moving Object Segmentation framework based on text query","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary we model the meta-training set as the combination of all the individual task specific training sets instead of a multi-task setting.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
