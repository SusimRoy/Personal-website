&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we model the meta-training set as the combination of all the individual task specific training sets instead of a multi-task setting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We understand the cross-domain connection stored in the feature extractor using our Memory Augmented Propagation network which stores the information from the previous layers of our backbone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We apply self-attention on each output feature map of the layers of our backbone in a hierarchical manner to find co-dependency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We test on the popular CIFAR-FS and miniImageNet datasets and find that our results are at par and sometimes even better than convolutional based SOTA approaches like MetaOptNet.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>On Discriminating Intentional Adversarial Perturbations with Unintentional Noises</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project19/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project19/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We propose a class-independent detection method, CIAI, using Maximum Mean Discrepancy and classifying the intended and unintended noise separately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We show how both types of noises affect the classification accuracy for gender prediction on the CelebA dataset. We show the detection accuracy which is comparable and at times exceeds the previous state-of-the-art detection methods including performance on unseen attacks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using attention maps we further show features that help with the prediction of gender and detection of noises.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Robustness of BNNs against White Box Attacks</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project17/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project17/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An experimental work where we tested whether BNN posteriors are more robust to gradient based adversarial attacks when compared to the general learning based neural networks in SOTA architectures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented BNN posterior in Alexnet,LeNet, Resnet34 and a custom made CNN to test the validity of the theoretical result. Each of these 4 models were attacked with FGSM and PGD variants.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented two bayesian estimation methods namely the conventional variational inference and one of it&amp;rsquo;s modified version called local reparametrisation trick into the three above models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Results indicate that Resnet34 takes a much longer time to train and has relatively poorer classification accuracy as compared to the other three models. A hypothesis supporting this fact is that Resnet34 has a more complex structure which doesn&amp;rsquo;t model the data distribution properly through the priors at each block.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Training with Continuous Sensor System Parameters and Irregular Data</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Modelling of noise for CT simulations(e.g. Poisson-noise)by considering spatially non-uniform intensity distributions and in limited dosage environments(ULDCT).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a pattern so that the intensity distribution becomes learnable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apply an appropriate reconstruction technique which takes care of artifacts or likely noise patterns and generates back the original image which has high metric values when compared with ssim etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Visual Motion Analysis from Images and Videos</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project16/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The main objective was to work towards developing a software to find the optimal time to spray fungicides to prevent the spread of FHB disease among the common vegetation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wheat and Canola flower data collection and annotation using SCVAT and storing them as PASCAL-VOC or YOLO format.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improving Yolov8 and Efficient-Det(pytorch version) algorithms to work on the created dataset by tuning hyperparameters in the former case and incorporating an attention module(e.g. CBAM) in the latter case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployment of the trained models on the &lt;a href="https://demo.sga.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo Website&lt;/a> for usage by farmers and similar people for FHB prevention.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conducted an extensive literature survey of diffusion models and their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented an architecture which works with different pretrained DDPMs and classifiers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developed a novel adversarial attack using the Class-Activation Maps of classifiers and the predicted noise maps from the UNet model of a DDPM which gives a better attack in terms of ASR, Robust accuracy and FID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worked with datasets like CIFAR10, CelebaHQ, FFHQ etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Given an input video data, we find the most informative slides and summarize the content in the video in the form of natural language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We first encode the images using the CLIP model and then pass it through a U-Net inspired transformer encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections in order to score each frame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, the frame-level scores to shot-level scores and finally use dynamic programming (0/1 knapsack) to decide which shots to pick as keyshots.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Deep Q Learning</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project8/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The objective was to train a RL agent to play the world&amp;rsquo;s hardest game which is essentially to reach a goal point among arbitratrily moving obstacles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a simple MLP which projects from a n-dimensional state space to a m-dimensional action state which the RL agent should take.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a custom reward function which penalizes the agent for being idle or getting stuck by an obstacle and rewards it for reaching the goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Federated Learning</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project10/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- Implemented the FedAvg algorithm from scratch on three popular datasets, namely MNIST, Coloured-MNIST and SVHN. &lt;br/>
- Compared them with the case when they were trained and tested in a non-federated manner. &lt;br/></description></item><item><title>Feedback Approach to Foster Motion Information in FPAR</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project6/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved the existing SparNet architecture by encorporating a feedback mechanism which basically embeds the finer information from the later layers of Resnet in it&amp;rsquo;s earlier layers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Motion Prediction Block used the knowledge from the Action Recognition Block to incorporate it back into that in it&amp;rsquo;s first layer while taking care of the dimensions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed the model on a webpage using flask framework where an user can input a video or an image and gets returned a heat map indicating the location of the action.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Multimodal Art Database</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project11/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- A user had to input an artistic image and our software would detect the top k artists who could have possibly made the painting and store them in a local MariaDB database. &lt;br/>
- To find the similarity between input painting and the database, we used the CLIP model to first finetune on our art database and then using the cosine similarity between the stored embeddings and our input feature embedding. &lt;br/>
- The most likely images got stored in a normalized SQL tables with foreign keys linking between the image id table and the artist id table.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Adversarial Perturbations While Determining Intentional and Unintentional Noises</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We proposed a class-independent detection method, CIAI, using Maximum Mean Discrepancy which classifies the intended(adversarial attacks) and unintended(for e.g. Gaussian) noise separately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The algorithm is multistage indicating that in the first stage, we use an MMD-based loss to train a Vision
Transformer initialized with trained classifier weights and in the second stage we use the trained detector for classification by freezing all the layers and adding three trainable layers for training.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We show the detection accuracy which is comparable and at times exceeds the previous state-of-the-art detection methods, including performance on unseen attacks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Referring Moving Object Segmentation</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conducted an extensive literature survey to understand the working of the SOTA models like Referformer, MTTR etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved RefVos by including the temporal information from the frames by taking their difference and sending it as input along with the 2nd frame among every 3 consecutive frame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To capture the new variety of features, made a new convolutional decoder to interpret the spatial and temporal information into accurately segmenting the object.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Researched into joining the language and visual features using modules introduced by different papers such as a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Feature Mining technique among others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extended the training and testing dataset to JHMDB and DAVIS-17 along with the standard A2D dataset.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Created a website with VueJS and tailwindcss where an user can input an Apple playlist and a Spotify playlist will be created in their account which can be private/public as per their choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used an Apple token to get songs from the user&amp;rsquo;s playlist and thereby sent GET requests to Spotify to fetch the songs and finally sending a POST request to make the playlist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The algorithm we used to get the songs from Spotify is to add the first song which appears on searching with the corresponding name in the Apple playlist.&lt;/li>

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="mindmaps">Mindmaps&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply insert a Markdown &lt;code>markmap&lt;/code> code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">
&lt;pre class="chroma">
&lt;code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
- wowchemy

&lt;/code>
&lt;/pre>
&lt;/div>

&lt;h3 id="charts">Charts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wowchemy supports the popular &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plotly&lt;/a> format for interactive charts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example &lt;code>line-chart.json&lt;/code>, and then add the &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; chart data=&amp;quot;line-chart&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demo:&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="chart-591286743" class="chart">&lt;/div>
&lt;script>
(function() {
let a = setInterval( function() {
if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) {
return;
}
clearInterval( a );
Plotly.d3.json("./line-chart.json", function(chart) {
Plotly.plot('chart-591286743', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true});
});
}, 500 );
})();
&lt;/script>
&lt;p>You might also find the &lt;a href="http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plotly JSON Editor&lt;/a> useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="math">Math&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code>math&lt;/code> option in your &lt;code>config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To render &lt;em>inline&lt;/em> or &lt;em>block&lt;/em> math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> or &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code>, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy &lt;em>math&lt;/em> shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The &lt;em>math&lt;/em> shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example &lt;strong>math block&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nb">{{&lt;/span>&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class="nb">}}&lt;/span>
