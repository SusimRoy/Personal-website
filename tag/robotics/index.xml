- An autonomous drone had to navigate in hilly environment and store it's path while moving towards the goal point following which a UGV would follow the path made by the UAV and reach the endpoint. &lt;br/>
- Used OpenCV and segmentation techniques along with ROS to segment out road from surroundings using depth images.&lt;br/>
- Analyzed the drone movement using Gazebo and RVIZ in order to accurately find an optimal path for the UGV. &lt;br/>
- Sent messages to the UGV using ROSBags for it's movement post UAV arrival at goal.</description></item><item><title>International Micromouse Challenge</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project13/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project13/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- The objective was to make the micromouse autnomously reach a goal point after navigating through a maze. &lt;br/>
- Implemented the wall-following algorithm so that the micromouse keeps following a single wall using ROS. &lt;br/></description></item><item><title>Autonomous Drone Obstacle Avoidance</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project14/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project14/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- An autonomous drone had to navigate in varying environment, starting from taking off and then detecting an Aruco Marker and landing on it. &lt;br/>
- Worked on detection of aruco marker and it's take-off and landing using ardupilot. &lt;br/>
- Worked on converting pointcloud data to laserscan for swift movement of the drone.</description></item></channel></rss>
