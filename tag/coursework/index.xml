&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we model the meta-training set as the combination of all the individual task specific training sets instead of a multi-task setting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We understand the cross-domain connection stored in the feature extractor using our Memory Augmented Propagation network which stores the information from the previous layers of our backbone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We apply self-attention on each output feature map of the layers of our backbone in a hierarchical manner to find co-dependency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We test on the popular CIFAR-FS and miniImageNet datasets and find that our results are at par and sometimes even better than convolutional based SOTA approaches like MetaOptNet.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An experimental work where we tested whether BNN posteriors are more robust to gradient based adversarial attacks when compared to the general learning based neural networks in SOTA architectures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented BNN posterior in Alexnet,LeNet, Resnet34 and a custom made CNN to test the validity of the theoretical result. Each of these 4 models were attacked with FGSM and PGD variants.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented two bayesian estimation methods namely the conventional variational inference and one of it&amp;rsquo;s modified version called local reparametrisation trick into the three above models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Results indicate that Resnet34 takes a much longer time to train and has relatively poorer classification accuracy as compared to the other three models. A hypothesis supporting this fact is that Resnet34 has a more complex structure which doesn&amp;rsquo;t model the data distribution properly through the priors at each block.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conducted an extensive literature survey of diffusion models and their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented an architecture which works with different pretrained DDPMs and classifiers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developed a novel adversarial attack using the Class-Activation Maps of classifiers and the predicted noise maps from the UNet model of a DDPM which gives a better attack in terms of ASR, Robust accuracy and FID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worked with datasets like CIFAR10, CelebaHQ, FFHQ etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Given an input video data, we find the most informative slides and summarize the content in the video in the form of natural language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We first encode the images using the CLIP model and then pass it through a U-Net inspired transformer encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections in order to score each frame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, the frame-level scores to shot-level scores and finally use dynamic programming (0/1 knapsack) to decide which shots to pick as keyshots.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The objective was to train a RL agent to play the world&amp;rsquo;s hardest game which is essentially to reach a goal point among arbitratrily moving obstacles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a simple MLP which projects from a n-dimensional state space to a m-dimensional action state which the RL agent should take.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a custom reward function which penalizes the agent for being idle or getting stuck by an obstacle and rewards it for reaching the goal.&lt;/li>

- Implemented the FedAvg algorithm from scratch on three popular datasets, namely MNIST, Coloured-MNIST and SVHN. &lt;br/>
- Compared them with the case when they were trained and tested in a non-federated manner. &lt;br/></description></item><item><title>Feedback Approach to Foster Motion Information in FPAR</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project6/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved the existing SparNet architecture by encorporating a feedback mechanism which basically embeds the finer information from the later layers of Resnet in it&amp;rsquo;s earlier layers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Motion Prediction Block used the knowledge from the Action Recognition Block to incorporate it back into that in it&amp;rsquo;s first layer while taking care of the dimensions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed the model on a webpage using flask framework where an user can input a video or an image and gets returned a heat map indicating the location of the action.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Multimodal Art Database</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project11/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- A user had to input an artistic image and our software would detect the top k artists who could have possibly made the painting and store them in a local MariaDB database. &lt;br/>
- To find the similarity between input painting and the database, we used the CLIP model to first finetune on our art database and then using the cosine similarity between the stored embeddings and our input feature embedding. &lt;br/>
- The most likely images got stored in a normalized SQL tables with foreign keys linking between the image id table and the artist id table.</description></item><item><title>Pokemon Dashboard</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project7/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A single webpage which shows different features of different pokemons and compares them with each other through multiple visualizations using interactive and informative graphics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used interactive graphics like bubble plot along with radar plots and parallel graph plots to show distinctions between pokemons.&lt;/li>
