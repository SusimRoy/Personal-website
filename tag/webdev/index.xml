- A user had to input an artistic image and our software would detect the top k artists who could have possibly made the painting and store them in a local MariaDB database. &lt;br/>
- To find the similarity between input painting and the database, we used the CLIP model to first finetune on our art database and then using the cosine similarity between the stored embeddings and our input feature embedding. &lt;br/>
- The most likely images got stored in a normalized SQL tables with foreign keys linking between the image id table and the artist id table.</description></item><item><title>Playlist Converter</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/project/project5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Created a website with VueJS and tailwindcss where an user can input an Apple playlist and a Spotify playlist will be created in their account which can be private/public as per their choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used an Apple token to get songs from the user&amp;rsquo;s playlist and thereby sent GET requests to Spotify to fetch the songs and finally sending a POST request to make the playlist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The algorithm we used to get the songs from Spotify is to add the first song which appears on searching with the corresponding name in the Apple playlist.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A single webpage which shows different features of different pokemons and compares them with each other through multiple visualizations using interactive and informative graphics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used interactive graphics like bubble plot along with radar plots and parallel graph plots to show distinctions between pokemons.&lt;/li>
