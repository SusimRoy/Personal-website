&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we model the meta-training set as the combination of all the individual task specific training sets instead of a multi-task setting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We understand the cross-domain connection stored in the feature extractor using our Memory Augmented Propagation network which stores the information from the previous layers of our backbone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We apply self-attention on each output feature map of the layers of our backbone in a hierarchical manner to find co-dependency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We test on the popular CIFAR-FS and miniImageNet datasets and find that our results are at par and sometimes even better than convolutional based SOTA approaches like MetaOptNet.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An experimental work where we tested whether BNN posteriors are more robust to gradient based adversarial attacks when compared to the general learning based neural networks in SOTA architectures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented BNN posterior in Alexnet,LeNet, Resnet34 and a custom made CNN to test the validity of the theoretical result. Each of these 4 models were attacked with FGSM and PGD variants.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented two bayesian estimation methods namely the conventional variational inference and one of it&amp;rsquo;s modified version called local reparametrisation trick into the three above models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Results indicate that Resnet34 takes a much longer time to train and has relatively poorer classification accuracy as compared to the other three models. A hypothesis supporting this fact is that Resnet34 has a more complex structure which doesn&amp;rsquo;t model the data distribution properly through the priors at each block.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Modelling of noise for CT simulations(e.g. Poisson-noise)by considering spatially non-uniform intensity distributions and in limited dosage environments(ULDCT).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a pattern so that the intensity distribution becomes learnable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apply an appropriate reconstruction technique which takes care of artifacts or likely noise patterns and generates back the original image which has high metric values when compared with ssim etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The main objective was to work towards developing a software to find the optimal time to spray fungicides to prevent the spread of FHB disease among the common vegetation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wheat and Canola flower data collection and annotation using SCVAT and storing them as PASCAL-VOC or YOLO format.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improving Yolov8 and Efficient-Det(pytorch version) algorithms to work on the created dataset by tuning hyperparameters in the former case and incorporating an attention module(e.g. CBAM) in the latter case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployment of the trained models on the &lt;a href="https://demo.sga.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo Website&lt;/a> for usage by farmers and similar people for FHB prevention.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conducted an extensive literature survey of diffusion models and their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implemented an architecture which works with different pretrained DDPMs and classifiers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developed a novel adversarial attack using the Class-Activation Maps of classifiers and the predicted noise maps from the UNet model of a DDPM which gives a better attack in terms of ASR, Robust accuracy and FID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worked with datasets like CIFAR10, CelebaHQ, FFHQ etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Given an input video data, we find the most informative slides and summarize the content in the video in the form of natural language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We first encode the images using the CLIP model and then pass it through a U-Net inspired transformer encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections in order to score each frame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, the frame-level scores to shot-level scores and finally use dynamic programming (0/1 knapsack) to decide which shots to pick as keyshots.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved the existing SparNet architecture by encorporating a feedback mechanism which basically embeds the finer information from the later layers of Resnet in it&amp;rsquo;s earlier layers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Motion Prediction Block used the knowledge from the Action Recognition Block to incorporate it back into that in it&amp;rsquo;s first layer while taking care of the dimensions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed the model on a webpage using flask framework where an user can input a video or an image and gets returned a heat map indicating the location of the action.&lt;/li>

- A user had to input an artistic image and our software would detect the top k artists who could have possibly made the painting and store them in a local MariaDB database. &lt;br/>
- To find the similarity between input painting and the database, we used the CLIP model to first finetune on our art database and then using the cosine similarity between the stored embeddings and our input feature embedding. &lt;br/>
- The most likely images got stored in a normalized SQL tables with foreign keys linking between the image id table and the artist id table.</description></item><item><title>UAV Guided UGV Movement</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/project/project12/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/project/project12/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>
- An autonomous drone had to navigate in hilly environment and store it's path while moving towards the goal point following which a UGV would follow the path made by the UAV and reach the endpoint. &lt;br/>
- Used OpenCV and segmentation techniques along with ROS to segment out road from surroundings using depth images.&lt;br/>
- Analyzed the drone movement using Gazebo and RVIZ in order to accurately find an optimal path for the UGV. &lt;br/>
- Sent messages to the UGV using ROSBags for it's movement post UAV arrival at goal.</description></item><item><title>Face Recognition using Clustering Algorithms.</title><link>https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/project/project15/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://SusimRoy.github.io/Personal-wesbite/project/project15/</guid><description>&lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Used the haarCascades to detect the face in a real-time video and then apply our model to check whether the user has worn a mask or not.&lt;/li>
