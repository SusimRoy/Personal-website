## Summary 
- The main objective was to work towards developing a software to find the optimal time to spray fungicides to prevent the spread of FHB disease among the common vegetation.
- Wheat and Canola flower data collection and annotation using SCVAT and storing them as PASCAL-VOC or YOLO format.
- Improving Yolov8 and Efficient-Det(pytorch version) algorithms to work on the created dataset by tuning hyperparameters in the former case and incorporating an attention module(e.g. CBAM) in the latter case. 
- Deployment of the trained models on the [demo Website](https://demo.sga.ai/) for usage by farmers and similar people for FHB prevention.
