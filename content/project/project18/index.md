## Summary 
- Conducted an extensive literature survey of diffusion models and their advantages and disadvantages. 
- Implemented an architecture which works with different pretrained DDPMs and classifiers. 
- Developed a novel adversarial attack using the Class-Activation Maps of classifiers and the predicted noise maps from the UNet model of a DDPM.
- Worked with datasets like CIFAR10, CelebaHQ
