## Summary 
- Modelling of noise for CT simulations(e.g. Poisson-noise)by considering spatially non-uniform intensity distributions and in limited dosage environments(ULDCT). 
- Create a pattern so that the intensity distribution becomes learnable.
- Apply an appropriate reconstruction technique which takes care of artifacts or likely noise patterns and generates back the original image which has high metric values when compared with ssim etc.
