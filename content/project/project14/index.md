<h2>Summary</h2> 
- An autonomous drone had to navigate in varying environment, starting from taking off and then detecting an Aruco Marker and landing on it. <br/>
-  Worked on detection of aruco marker and it's take-off and landing using ardupilot. <br/>
- Worked on converting pointcloud data to laserscan for swift movement of the drone.
