<h2>Summary</h2> 
- Deploy a web model where an user can input an image and gets returned the most similar looking images to his face from a database. <br/>
-  Using clustering algorithms such as Resnet with PCA for feature dimensionality reduction, find the most similar faces with respect to the user.
