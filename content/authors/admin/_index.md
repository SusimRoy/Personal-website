I am a Master of Science student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Buffalo. My current research focuses on increasing the trustability and precision of generative models in resource-constrained environments under the supervision of [Prof. Nalini Ratha](https://nalini-ratha.github.io/). Previously, I was an Undergraduate at [IIT Jodhpur](iitj.ac.in) in the Department of Computer Science where I have worked on adversarial learning and leveraging foundation models for biometric applications at the [Image Analysis and Biometrics Lab](https://iab-rubric.org/people/undergrads) advised by [Dr. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Dr. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/).
